#Multiplier for base Apotheosis values (gems, affixes, effects, etc.)
#Examples:
#  1.0 = default values (no change)
#  0.5 = reduce all values by 50%
#  2.0 = double all values
#This affects ONLY base Apotheosis content:
#  - Gem attribute bonuses (attack speed, damage, armor, etc.)
#  - Affix attribute values
#  - Durability bonuses
#  - Potion effect durations and amplifiers
#  - All other numerical bonuses from BASE Apotheosis
#Changes require game restart to take effect.
#Range: 0.0 ~ 100.0
apotheosisMultiplier = 1.0
#Multiplier for ApotheoticAdditions values
#This is separate from base Apotheosis multiplier!
#ApotheoticAdditions adds new rarities: Relic, Heirloom, Esoteric
#and many new gems and affixes with higher values.
#Examples:
#  1.0 = default values
#  0.7 = reduce by 30% (recommended for balance)
#  0.5 = reduce by 50%
#This affects ONLY ApotheoticAdditions content.
#Changes require game restart to take effect.
#Range: 0.0 ~ 100.0
additionsMultiplier = 1.0
#Fallback multiplier used when mod detection fails
#This is used for any StepFunction calls that can't be traced
#to either Apotheosis or ApotheoticAdditions.
#Usually you want this to match apotheosisMultiplier.
#Range: 0.0 ~ 100.0
fallbackMultiplier = 1.0
#Multiplier for quality values in affix loot entries
#Quality affects:
#  1. Luck-based selection (higher quality = more likely with luck)
#  2. Number of affixes that can roll on items
#Examples:
#  1.0 = no change (default)
#  0.5 = reduce quality by 50% (fewer affixes, less luck impact)
#  0.7 = reduce quality by 30%
#This is VERY useful for balance - lower quality = simpler items with fewer affixes!
#Changes require game restart to take effect.
#Range: 0.0 ~ 100.0
qualityMultiplier = 1.0
#Shift min_rarity for all affix loot entries (weapons, armor, etc.)
#Positive values increase minimum rarity, negative values decrease it.
#Examples:
#  0 = no change (default)
#  -1 = decrease by one rarity level (rare → uncommon)
#  -2 = decrease by two levels (mythic → rare)
#  +1 = increase by one level (common → uncommon)
#Clamped to valid rarity range (won't go below common or above ancient).
#Changes require game restart to take effect.
#Range: -10 ~ 10
minRarityOffset = 0
#Shift max_rarity for all affix loot entries (weapons, armor, etc.)
#Positive values increase maximum rarity, negative values decrease it.
#Examples:
#  0 = no change (default)
#  -1 = decrease by one rarity level (mythic → epic)
#  -2 = decrease by two levels (mythic → rare)
#  +1 = increase by one level (rare → epic)
#Clamped to valid rarity range.
#Changes require game restart to take effect.
